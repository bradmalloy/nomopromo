# NoMoPromo

I got annoyed one night that the thing I thought was a video I could watch, was instead a cleverly disguised ad for an upcoming video.

No thanks, wrote this (using yeoman.io) to remove all such results from my subscriptions stream.

Removes cards from the Youtube web interface which have a "set reminder" button or the text "premiere".
